	<p>Get Involved London is a place for Londoners to learn about and participate in City projects and initiatives.</p>

	<p>This page will help you learn how your municipal government works so you can tap into the opportunities to have your say.</p>

    <h2>Have your say</h2>
    <p><img src="images/meeting.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="meetings"/>In order to be given delegation status (request to speak) at a Standing Committee meeting you must make a request in writing to the City Clerk’s Office stating the purpose of your request.  If it falls within the jurisdiction of the City of London we will place the request on the next available agenda for the appropriate Standing Committee. The Standing Committee will then make a recommendation to Municipal Council as to whether or not they wish to receive the delegation at a future meeting of the Standing Committee. </p>
	<p>If the request is approved by Council the delegation would then be placed on a future agenda of the Standing Committee.</p>
    <p>Londoners can also speak at a Public Participation Meeting before a Standing Committee. If a Public Participation Meeting is scheduled the public can register to speak prior to the agenda deadline and be listed on the agenda as a delegation, together with a written submission if they have one.  Otherwise the public can just attend the meeting and the Chair of the Standing Committee will recognize them to speak after any individuals who have registered to speak by the agenda deadline.</p>
